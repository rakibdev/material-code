## Usage

Theme works straight away. For additional styling like rounded corners select `"Material Code: Apply styles"` from command palette (F1 or Ctrl+Shift+P). To disable select `"Material Code: Disable styles"`.

Applying or disabling styles modifies editor workbench.html file. Extension may ask for administrative privileges if necessary. After applying editor may show notification "Installation corrupted", select `"Don't show again"`.

Everytime Visual Studio Code updates overwrites extension's applied styles. Extension will ask to re-apply or you can manually apply from command pallete.
