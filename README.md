## Usage

Theme works straight away. For additional styling like rounded corners select `"Material Code: Apply styles"` from command palette (F1 or Ctrl+Shift+P). To disable select `"Material Code: Remove styles"`.
After adding any custom CSS in settings you will need to re-apply from command palette to see changes.

Applying or disabling styles modifies editor workbench.html file. Extension may ask for administrative privileges if necessary. After applying editor may show notification "Installation corrupted", select `"Don't show again"`.
